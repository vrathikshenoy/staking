# Staking on Sepolia Testnet with Thirdweb

This repository demonstrates a staking application built using Thirdweb, designed to be deployed and tested on the Sepolia test network. Here, you'll experiment with staking functionalities in a simulated environment before interacting with a mainnet deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
- Access to a Sepolia testnet node or RPC endpoint. Refer to the Sepolia documentation at [Sepolia Testnet](sepolia.metamask.io) for instructions on setting up a node or finding a public RPC endpoint.
- An Ethereum wallet with testnet Ether (ETH) for gas fees and staking purposes. MetaMask is a popular option that supports testnets.
- A Thirdweb project with an API key. Create a Thirdweb project at [Thirdweb Portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/cli/create) and obtain your API key from the dashboard.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vrathikshenoy/staking.git
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install (or yarn install)

    ```

3. Configure the application with your Sepholia test network credentials and other necessary chain using below .

     ```bash
    
    import { Sepolia } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains"; 

     <ThirdwebProvider activeChain={Sepolia}>

    ```
    
   

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, users can interact with it through the provided UI or API endpoints to stake their cryptocurrency assets and monitor their rewards.

This will typically start the application on http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if specified in your code). You can access the staking interface in your web browser.

## Testing

Thoroughly test your staking application to ensure it functions as expected on the Sepolia testnet. Consider various scenarios, including:

1. Staking different amounts of ETH.
2. Unstaking ETH.
3. Earning staking rewards.
4. Handling errors and edge cases.

It's essential to conduct comprehensive testing to verify the correctness and robustness of your staking application. Write test cases that cover all functionalities, including both normal and exceptional scenarios. Automated testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha can be valuable for this purpose, allowing you to run tests efficiently and consistently.

During testing, pay attention to the following aspects:

- Ensure that staking and unstaking operations are executed correctly, reflecting the changes in staked amounts and rewards.
- Verify that rewards are accurately calculated based on staked amounts and the duration of staking.
- Test error handling mechanisms to confirm that the application gracefully handles unexpected inputs, network failures, or contract errors.
- Evaluate the performance of your application under various conditions, including different network speeds and transaction volumes.

By conducting thorough testing, you can increase confidence in the reliability and stability of your staking application, paving the way for a successful deployment on the Sepolia testnet.


## Deployment (Optional)

If you intend to deploy your staking application to a mainnet environment, you'll need to:

1. Configure the application to use a mainnet provider URL and chain ID.
2. Replace testnet contract addresses with their mainnet counterparts.
3. Securely manage private keys or wallet connections in production.
4. Deploy the application to a suitable hosting platform.

## Disclaimer

Remember that this is a testnet environment, and any ETH or other assets used here have no real-world value. Exercise caution when deploying to a mainnet and always back up your code and data.

## Additional Notes

- Consult Thirdweb's documentation ([Thirdweb Portal](https://portal.thirdweb.com/)) for detailed guidance on interacting with their staking functionalities.
